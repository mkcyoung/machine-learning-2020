To run the code, make sure you are in the directory with main.py and run.sh,
then simply type 'sh run.sh' into the terminal. This assumes that you logged into one of the linux CADE systems, because the windows systems apparently do not have numpy installed. 

The results the hw requested us to display will print out, the plots print out as well. To continue the script you must exit out of the plots as they pop up. The SVM over trees cross validation section takes a long time, ~10-15 minutes.

Additonally, there's an overflow warning that occurs w/ logistic regression, just ignore it :).
