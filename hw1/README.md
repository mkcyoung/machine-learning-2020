To run the code, make sure you are in the directory with main.py and run.sh,
then simply type 'sh run.sh' into the terminal. This assumes that you logged into one of the linux CADE systems, because the windows systems apparently do not have numpy installed. 

The results the hw requested us to display will print out, hopefully in < 30 seconds.

I added some additional results beyond what the hw asked us to print out to aid
me in my own analysis. The results are still in the order requested by the hw and 
shouldn't be difficult to find.
